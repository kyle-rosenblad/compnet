First ’ll build model just “ndtrait”, competitive niche differentiation process ’re interested . “ndtrait” driving competitive niche differentiation, expect species pairs differ strongly trait greater co-occurrence affinity. ’ll model effect “ndtrait” co-occurrence affinity using “distance interaction” term. words, species pair, model use species ’s value “ndtrait”, species B’s value, absolute value difference two values. last term directly captures effect ’re interested , called “heterophily” social sciences (.e., things different attracted ). Social scientists often model heterophily using multiplicative interaction term instead distance term. use distance interaction term captures certain features competitive niche differentiation process multiplicative interaction terms can’t represent. (’ll see example later.) However, multiplicative interaction terms can provide advantages (’ll also note ). use multiplicative interaction term, just use ‘spvars_multi_int’ instead ‘spvars_dist_int’ example code. Stan, statistical software hood, uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm estimate results us. don’t let HMC sampler run enough iterations, can’t trust results. Stan tell us didn’t let model run long enough, provide web links help resources. try build good model, let’s deliberately tell Stan small number iterations can see warnings look like: Now let’s build first distance interaction model. ’ll call ‘nd_0_mod’ ’re using “ndtrait” predictor, ’re using default ‘rank’ value 0. (’ll discuss importance rank = 0 decision shortly.) Sometimes, takes tries gradually adjusting ‘warmup’ ‘iter’ ’re getting sufficient samples avoid warnings. ’ve already done trial error example data set, ’ll set ‘warmup’ ‘iter’ sweet spot. (default settings produce longer run, don’t need .) try interpret results, let’s see model provides reasonable fit data. One main concerns network data multiple forms non-independence can arise among observations, discussed Introduction. Let’s use ‘gofstats’ function check well model accounts types non-independence example data set: first ‘p-value’, ‘p.sd.rowmeans’, tells us patterns driven fact species pairs including given species share features common. ‘p.sd.rowmeans’ high, means simulate data model ’ve built (‘gofstats’ background), simulated data less kind non-independence real data. means model may good job accounting form non-independence among species pairs. Anything ’s super-high (around maybe 0.9ish ) usually considered fine, high. second value, ‘p.cycle.dep’, tells us higher-order multi-species patterns. can abstract challenging conceptualize. good example saying, “enemy enemy friend”. ‘p.cycle.dep’ looks high well. ’s telling us simulate data model, vast majority simulated data sets less high-order non-independence real data. Let’s try increasing ‘rank’, can helpful ‘gofstats’ aren’t looking good. Unsurprisingly, gofstats look fine. move forward model, recommend using ‘DHARMa’ package run additional checks model fit problems. ‘DHARMa’ doesn’t automatically install ‘compnet’. model diagnostic workflow, don’t need use . ’ll use ‘DHARMa’ check overdispersion, quantile deviations, uniformity, zero inflation. can read issues accompanying tests ‘DHARMa’ vignette. general, wary tiny p-values, warning messages, visual patterns deviate strongly expected patterns shown DHARMa’s output graphs. However, large data set, can get tiny p-values even deviations expected patterns trivial. diagnostic plots key cases.     looks fine. Going forward, keep vignette brief, ’ll suppress plots accompany DHARMa tests, always recommend checking plots ’re analyzing data. Now let’s explore results. First ’ll peek coefficients predictors interest: Let’s see violin plots:  Now ’ll make scatterplot, point species pair. x axis represent trait value “Species ” (vs B arbitrary), y axis represent co-occurrence probability. ’ll include curves mean expectation 95% credible intervals. multiple curves, conditioned different value focal trait “Species B”. default, scatter_interaction() function generate plot conditioning mean values predictor variables pertaining traits. (example model, “ndtrait” trait.)  Cool! Species B low value “ndtrait”, co-occurrence probability increases Species ’s “ndtrait” value. words, low value “ndtrait”, ’ll likely co-occur species high values. pattern consistent competitive niche differentiation. Similarly, Species B’s “ndtrait” value high, co-occurrence probability decreases Species ’s value. Additionally, Species B intermediate value “ndtrait”, co-occurrence probability higher Species ’s value either extreme, dip middle. (pattern multiplicative interaction models–opposed distance interaction models–struggle represent.) Overall, plot exemplifies results expect metacommunity shaped competitive niche differentiation.","code":"shortrun <- buildcompnet(presabs=ex_presabs,                   spvars_dist_int=ex_traits[c(\"ndtrait\")],                   warmup=100,                   iter=200) #>  #> SAMPLING FOR MODEL 'srm_fnchypg' NOW (CHAIN 1). #> Chain 1:  #> Chain 1: Gradient evaluation took 0.000605 seconds #> Chain 1: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 6.05 seconds. #> Chain 1: Adjust your expectations accordingly! #> Chain 1:  #> Chain 1:  #> Chain 1: WARNING: There aren't enough warmup iterations to fit the #> Chain 1:          three stages of adaptation as currently configured. #> Chain 1:          Reducing each adaptation stage to 15%/75%/10% of #> Chain 1:          the given number of warmup iterations: #> Chain 1:            init_buffer = 15 #> Chain 1:            adapt_window = 75 #> Chain 1:            term_buffer = 10 #> Chain 1:  #> Chain 1: Iteration:   1 / 200 [  0%]  (Warmup) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  20 / 200 [ 10%]  (Warmup) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  40 / 200 [ 20%]  (Warmup) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  60 / 200 [ 30%]  (Warmup) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  80 / 200 [ 40%]  (Warmup) #> Chain 1: Iteration: 100 / 200 [ 50%]  (Warmup) #> Chain 1: Iteration: 101 / 200 [ 50%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration: 120 / 200 [ 60%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration: 140 / 200 [ 70%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration: 160 / 200 [ 80%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration: 180 / 200 [ 90%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration: 200 / 200 [100%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1:  #> Chain 1:  Elapsed Time: 5.166 seconds (Warm-up) #> Chain 1:                4.304 seconds (Sampling) #> Chain 1:                9.47 seconds (Total) #> Chain 1: #> Warning: There were 1 chains where the estimated Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information was low.

Let’s include “domtrait” covariate. Including suspected confounder covariate can help us quest unbiased estimate effect “ndtrait” co-occurrence probabilities. (can never perfect causal inference observational data, ’s worth getting close can. ’s another topic.) Let’s try new model using “ndtrait” “domtrait” distance interactions. ’ll start rank=0. model’s built, ’ll run gofstats() ‘DHARMa’ checks. ’ve got borderline issue high-order non-independence clear issue overdispersion. Let’s try ‘rank’=1 next. ’ll notice increased ‘adapt_delta’ closer 1 avoid divergent transitions, one kind problem HMC sampler can run . ’ve solved overdispersion problem. residuals still show borderline case higher-order non-independence. now ’ll leave , want, can try increasing ‘rank’ 2 exercise. Let’s quick look latest results compare model covariate adjustment: coefficient “ndtrait” distance term greater new model. suggests covariate adjustment strategy helped “unmask” true effect “ndtrait” co-occurrence probability. Let’s see scatterplots look noticeably different:   effect species’ pairwise distances “ndtrait” noticeably stronger new model, adjusted potential confounder, “domtrait”.","code":"cor(ex_traits[c(\"ndtrait\", \"domtrait\")]) #>            ndtrait  domtrait #> ndtrait  1.0000000 0.4400044 #> domtrait 0.4400044 1.0000000 nd_dom_0_mod <- buildcompnet(presabs=ex_presabs,                         spvars_dist_int=ex_traits[c(\"ndtrait\", \"domtrait\")],                         warmup=400,                         iter=1200) #>  #> SAMPLING FOR MODEL 'srm_fnchypg' NOW (CHAIN 1). #> Chain 1:  #> Chain 1: Gradient evaluation took 0.000502 seconds #> Chain 1: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 5.02 seconds. #> Chain 1: Adjust your expectations accordingly! #> Chain 1:  #> Chain 1:  #> Chain 1: Iteration:    1 / 1200 [  0%]  (Warmup) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  120 / 1200 [ 10%]  (Warmup) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  240 / 1200 [ 20%]  (Warmup) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  360 / 1200 [ 30%]  (Warmup) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  401 / 1200 [ 33%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  520 / 1200 [ 43%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  640 / 1200 [ 53%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  760 / 1200 [ 63%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration:  880 / 1200 [ 73%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration: 1000 / 1200 [ 83%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration: 1120 / 1200 [ 93%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1: Iteration: 1200 / 1200 [100%]  (Sampling) #> Chain 1:  #> Chain 1:  Elapsed Time: 9.171 seconds (Warm-up) #> Chain 1:                9.219 seconds (Sampling) #> Chain 1:                18.39 seconds (Total) #> Chain 1: #> Warning: There were 1 chains where the estimated Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information was low.
